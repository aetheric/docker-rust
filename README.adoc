= Docker: Rust

A development environment for rust that projects can use as a base.

== Usage

. Just make a `Dockerfile` in your project like this:

	FROM aetheric/rust:stable

	# Add needed alpine packages
	RUN apk --no-cache add --virtual .build-dependencies \
		glibc

	# Install whatever binaries you need
	RUN cargo install cargo-watch

	# Make sure to clean up your apk additions.
	RUN apk del .build-dependencies

. Then call the following command to run a build:

	docker build . \
		--tag reponame/projectname

. And finally, get to running docker commands:

	docker run reponame/projectname \
		--volume .:/usr/src/app \
		--tty \
		watch

It's a good idea to put that last one in a script so commands can be run against the project a lot easier. Alternately, you can run it with the `--interactive` flag to just keep running commands.
